# Frontend-apps

In this repository, we develop full-blown applications running inside the user browser, while leveraging what we've learned so far about JS to communicate with backend APIs.

## Learning objectives
- Test-drive a simple Javascript program running in a web browser, using modern JS build tools.
- Use the DOM API to manipulate the web page structure and content.
- Use fetch to send HTTP requests to a remote server.
